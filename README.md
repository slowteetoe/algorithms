Some random algorithms implemented in Go, from a Coursera class on Algorithms

## Union-Find
*       find : check if 2 objects are in the same connected component
*       union : replace the component containing two objects with their union

#### quick-find
#### quick-union
#### weighted quick-union with path compression
